# MySQL - SQL - List Functions (ifnull, greatest)

- independent of datatype

Uses:-
a. to set a lower limit on some value

bonus = 10% sal, min bonus = 300

```sql
select greatest(sal*0.1,300) from emp;

select greatest(sal,3000,4000,5000,10000) from emp;


greatest (val1, val2, val3,....,val255)

greatest (col1, col2, col3,....,col255)

greatest( ' str1', 'str2', 'str3')

greatest( 'date1' , 'date2' , 'date3' , 'date4')

greatest( 'time1' , 'time2 ' , 'time3')

greatest( ' datetime1' , 'datetime2 ' , 'datetime3')



set x= greatest(a,b,c,d);


select least(sa1,3000 from emp;  --returns the smaller of the two

1000
2000
3000
3000
3000
```

Uses: â€”
a. to set an upper limit on some value

e.g.
cashback = 10% amt, max cashback = 300

```sql
select least(amt*0.1,300) from orders;

select least(sal, 3000, 4000, 5000, 10000) from emp;


least (val1, val2, val3,....,val255)

least (col1, col2, col3,....,col255)

least(num1,num2,num3)

least( ' str1', 'str2', 'str3')

least( 'date1' , 'date2' , 'date3' )

least ( 'time1' , 'time2 ' , 'time3')

least ( ' datetime1' , 'datetime2 ' , 'datetime3')


set x = least(a,b,c,d);
```

# MySQL - SQL - CASE keyword

MySQL - SQL - Group/Aggregate Functions

![alt text](Images/EmpTable2.png)

## Single-Row Functions:-

- operate on 1 row at a time
- Character, Number, Date and Time, List, Environment Functions
- e.g. upper (ename), round(sal), etc.

## Multi-Row Functions:-

- operate on multiple rows at a time
- Group Functions
- e.g. sum(sal)

select sum(sal) from emp;
35000
select internal work
![alt text](Images/InternalWork1.png)
only sal column load in RAM and put in into array AND only total i.e 35000 will send to client, then RAM will free

Assumption, 4th row SAL is null:-
![alt text](Images/InternalWork2.png)

```sql
select sum(sal) from emp; -- NULL VALUES ARE NOT COUNTED BY GROUP FUNCTIONS
26000

select sum(ifnull(sal,0)) from emp;
26000
```

Assumption, 4th row SAL is null:-

```sql
select avg(sal) from emp; --NULL VALUES ARE NOT COUNTED BY GROUP FUNCTIONS
26000/4 - > 6500

select avg(ifnull(sal,0)) from emp;
26000/5 -> 5200
```

Assumption, 4th row SAL is null:-

```sql
select min(sal) from emp;
3000

select min(ifnull(sal,0)) from emp;
0

Assumption, 4th row SAL is null:-

select max(sal) from emp;
8000
```

Assumption, 4th row SAL is null:-

```sql
select count(sal) from emp; --returns a count of number of rows where SAL is not having a null value
4

select count(*) from emp;  --returns a count of total number of rows in the table
5

select count(*) from emp; --how many employee
select count(sal) from emp; --how many geting sallary
select count(*) - count(sal) from emp; --how many not getting salary
```

```sql
select max(sal)/min(sal) from emp;
8000/3000 -> 2.67

select sum(sal)/count(\*) from emp; --FASTER, it goes only one in loop
26000/5

select avg(ifnull(sal,0)) from emp; --SLOW it goes two times in loop first for check null and then cal
26000/5
```

Assumption, 4th row SAL is 9000: -
![alt text](Images/InternalWork3.png)

```sql
select sum(sal) from emp
where deptno = 1;
18000
```

![alt text](Images/InternalWork4.png)

```sql
select avg(sal) from emp
where job = 'C';
6000
```

COUNT-QUERY (counting the number of query hits):-

```sql
select count(\*) from emp
where sal > 7000;
3

sum (column)

avg(column)

min(column) min(sal), min(ename), min(hiredate)

max(column) max(sal), max(ename), max(hiredate)

count(column) count(sal), count(ename), count(hiredate)

count(\*)

stddev(column)

variance(column)
```

## SUMMARY REPORT:-

```sql
select count(\*), min(sal), max(sal), sum(sal), avg(sal) from emp;
```

![alt text](Images/Output3.png)

## Restriction #1:-

- you cannot SELECT column of table alongwith a Group function

```sql
  select count(ename), max(sal) from emp;

select ename, max(sal) from emp; --ERROR
```

## Restriction #2:-

- you cannot SELECT a Single-row function alongwith a Group function

```sql
  select count(ename), max(sal) from emp;

select upper(ename), max(sal) from emp; --ERROR
```

## Restriction #3:-

- you cannot use Group function in the WHERE clause

```sql
  select \* from emp where sal > avg(sal); -- ERROR
```

# MySQL - SQL GROUP BY clause (V. Imp)

- used for grouping
  WHERE clause -> used for searching
  ORDER BY clause -> used for sorting
  FOR UPDATE clause -> used for locking the rows manually
  GROUP BY clause -> used for grouping

```sql
select sum(sal) from emp;
35000

select sum(sal) from emp
Where deptno = 1;

sum(sal) deptwise:-
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno;
```

5:30 afterward

```sql
SELECT clause -> select deptno, sum(sal)
FROM clause -> from emp
GROUP BY clause -> group by deptno
```

## Rule #1:-

Besides the Group function Whichever column is present in SELECT clause, it has to be present in GROUP BY clause

```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp; -- ERROR
```

![alt text](Images/Output4.png)

```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno;
```

![alt text](Images/Output5.png)

## Rule #2:-

Whichever column is present in GROUP BY clause,it may or may not be present in SELECT clause

```sql
select sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno;
```

![alt text](Images/Output6.png)

```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno;

select deptno, max(sal) from emp
group by deptno;

select deptno, min(sal) from emp
group by deptno;

select deptno, avg(sal) from emp
group by deptno;

select deptno, count(\*) from emp
group by deptno;
```

![alt text](Images/Output7.png)

- 2D query -> any SELECT statement with a GROUP BY clause is known as a 2D query, because you can plot a graph from the output

- MS Excel, Oracle Graphics, Oracle Apex, etc.

```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
where sal > 7000 --used to retrieve the rows
group by deptno;
```

- WHERE clause is specified BEFORE the GROUP BY clause

```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
where sal > 7000 and sal < 10000
group by deptno;

select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
where job = 'C'
group by deptno;

select job, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno;

select deptno, job, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno, job;
```

- no upper limit on the number of columns in GROUP BY clause

```sql
 select........................

group by city, state, city;
```

- if you have a large number of rows in the table, and if you have a large number of columns in GROUP BY clause, then the SELECT statement will be very slow, because that much sorting has to take place in Server RAM

- if you have 1 column in GROUP BY clause -> 2D query
- if you have 2 columns in GROUP BY clause -> 3D query
- if you have 3 columns in GROUP BY clause -> 4D query
  etc.

known as Multi-dimensional queries (also known as Spatial queries)

```sq;
select deptno, job, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno, job;

select job, deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by job, deptno;
```

![alt text](Images/LoopWork1.png)
outer loop should with less number of iterration and inner should be more for faster excution in any lang in nested loop
![alt text](Images/LoopWork2.png)

```sql
select
group by city, country, district, state; --SLOW

select
group by country, state, district, state; --FAST

select sum(sal), deptno, job from emp
group by job, deptno;
```

- the position of columns in SELECT clause and the position of columns in GROUP BY clause need not be the same

- the position of columns in SELECT clause will determine the position of columns in the output; this you will write as per User requirements

- the position of columns in GROUP BY clause will determine the sorting order, grouping order, summation order, and hence the speed of processing; this you will write as per count(distinct(columname))

```sql
select count(distinct deptno), count(distinct job) from emp;

select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno;
```

![alt text](Images/Output8.png)

```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno
having sum(sal) > 17000;
```

![alt text](Images/Output9.png)
![alt text](Images/InternalWork5.png)

- WHERE clause is used for searching
- searching takes place in DB Server HD
- WHERE clause is used to restrict the rows
- WHERE clause used to retrieve the rows from DB Server HD to
  Server RAM
- HAVING clause works AFTER the summation is done

```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
where sal > 7000
group by deptno;

select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno
having sal > 7000; <-ERROR
```

![alt text](Images/InternalWork6.png)

- Whichever column is present in SELECT clause, it can be used in HAVING clause

```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno
having deptno = 1; --WILL WORK BUT IT IS INEFFICIENT INSTEAD SHOULD HAVE USED WHERE DEPTNO = 1
```

- It's recommended that only the Group functions should be used in HAVING clause

```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno
having sum(sal) > 17000;

select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno
having sum(sal) > 17000 and sum(sal) < 25000;
```

1. Rows retrieved from DB Server HD to Server RAM
2. Sorting deptwise
3. Grouping deptwise
4. Summation deptwise
5. HAVING clause
6. ORDER BY clause

6.55

- ORDER BY clause is the LAST clause in SELECT statement

```sql
select ..............from...........
where.............
group by...................
having.................
order by................;
```

## MATRIX REPORT:-

```sql
select deptno, count(\*), min(sal), max(sal), sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno
order by 1;
```

In Other RDBMS:- 7.4

```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno;

select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno;
```

![alt text](Images/Output11.png)

```sql
select max(sum(sal)) from emp -- NESTING OF GROUP FUNCTIONS IS SUPPORTED BY ORACLE
group by deptno;
```

![alt text](Images/Output12.png)

In MySQL:-

```sql
- select sum(sal) sum_sal from emp
group by deptno;
```

![alt text](Images/Output13.png)

```sql
select max(sum_sal) from
(select sum(sal) sum_sal from emp
group by deptno) abcd;
